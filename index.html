        <p>Select one of the examples. The corresponding XML file will be rendered. Each XML file
        is associated with a secret XPath expression that selects some nodes (or attributes).
        You need to enter an XPath expression such as <code>/*</code> in order to make a first guess.</p>
        <p>For selecting namespaced elements with a prefix, such as <code>xsl:for-each</code> in the XSLT example,
          you can enter something like <code>//Q{http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform}for-each</code>
        or <code>//*:for-each</code>. Elements without a prefix can be selected without namespace if they
          are in the same namespace as the top-level element.</p>
        <p>You cannot select <code>//namespace-node()</code> (well, you can, but they won’t be displayed).
        You cannot select processing instructions or comments that are outside the top-level element, either.
        You can select elements, attributes, text nodes, comments, and processing instructions.</p>
      <p>As a result of evaluating your guess, the number of selected items will be displayed so you can
      see whether at least the count of selected items matches.</p>
      <p>In order to see how well your guess-selected items match, the items will be highlighted in the rendered
      XML (you might need to click into the rendering area and scroll down or sideways). The match quality
      will be signalled by color code and by tool tip. The tool tip contains both the hierarchical XPath to
      the item and the distance to the closest target item.</p>
      <p>Performance: The distance calculation scales with the product of secretly selected items and the
      items you guess. Therefore it can take a couple of seconds if these counts are around 30 or higher, 
      depending on your computer. All calculations will be carried out by XSLT 3.0 in the browser (see the
      links at the bottom of the page).</p>
      <h3>Distance metric</h3>
      <p>The distance metric works as follows for a given pair of items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find the common ancestor element of both items</li>
        <li>If one item is ancestor of the other, the element distance is the number of steps you need to climb up on
        the ancestor axis</li>
        <li>If an item is an attribute, text node, comment, or PI, calculate the element distance for its parent
        first and add 1 to the calculated distance later</li>
        <li>The distance is the number of steps up to the common ancestor plus the number of steps down to the
        other element.</li>
        <li>When the nodes below the common ancestor are siblings, count the number of siblings that you
        need to visit until you reach the other node.</li>
        <li>Then don’t take the two steps to the common ancestor and down to the other node, but take the
        sibling path instead.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>To Do</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>End the game when a maximum number of attempts has been reached. This number can already be defined
        for each URI / secret XPath tuple, but the application doesn’t stop when the max. number has been reached.</li>
        <li>Obfuscate the configuration and the current attempt number better. Or leave it as weakly secure as it is.</li>
        <li>Let users resume the game by storing session data in the Browser.</li>
      </ul>
