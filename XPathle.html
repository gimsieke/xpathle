        <p>Select one of the examples. The corresponding XML file will be rendered. Each XML file
        is associated with a secret XPath expression that selects some nodes (or attributes).
        You need to enter an XPath expression such as <code>/*</code> in order to make a first guess.</p>
        <p>For selecting namespaced elements with a prefix, such as <code>xsl:for-each</code> in the XSLT example,
          you can enter something like <code>//Q{http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform}for-each</code>
        or <code>//*:for-each</code>. Elements without a prefix can be selected without namespace if they
          are in the same namespace as the top-level element.</p>
        <p>You cannot select <code>//namespace-node()</code> (well, you can, but they won’t be displayed).
        You cannot select processing instructions or comments that are outside the top-level element, either.
        You can select elements, attributes, text nodes, comments, and processing instructions.</p>
      <p>As a result of evaluating your guess, the number of selected items will be displayed so you can
      see whether at least the count of selected items matches.</p>
      <p>In order to see how well your guess-selected items match, the items will be highlighted in the rendered
      XML (you might need to click into the rendering area and scroll down or sideways). The match quality
      will be signalled by color code and by tool tip. The tool tip contains both the hierarchical XPath to
      the item and the distance to the closest target item.</p>
      <p>Performance: The distance calculation scales with the product of secretly selected items and the
      items you guess. Therefore it can take a couple of seconds if these counts are around 30 or higher, 
      depending on your computer. All calculations will be carried out by XSLT 3.0 in the browser (see the
      links at the bottom of the page).</p>
      <p>The distance metric works as follows for a given pair of items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find the common ancestor element of both items</li>
        <li>If one item is ancestor of the other, the element distance is the number of steps you need to climb up on
        the ancestor axis</li>
        <li>If the </li>
        <li>The distance is the number of steps up to the common ancestor plus the number of steps down </li>
      </ul>
